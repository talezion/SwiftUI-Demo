# SwiftUI Wallet Sample App ü™ô

This SwiftUI project is a collection of hands-on examples that demonstrate core SwiftUI concepts including:

- `Text`, `Button`, `Image`, `List`, and `VStack` usage
- State management using `@State`, `@Binding`, and `@StateObject`
- Data sharing using `ObservableObject` and `@Published`
- Building dynamic lists with `ForEach`
- Simple animations and view modifiers

## üìÇ File Overview

| File                      | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `1_HelloView.swift`       | Basic `Text` component styled with font and color.                          |
| `2_CryptoCardView.swift`  | `VStack` layout with styled text simulating a coin card UI.                 |
| `3_CoinsView.swift`       | Uses `HStack` and `Spacer` to build a coin row layout.                      |
| `4_WalletView.swift`      | Demonstrates `@State`, text input, and wallet balance logic.                |
| `5_CoinsListView.swift`   | Displays a dynamic list of coins using `List` and `NavigationLink`.         |
| `6_MiningView.swift`      | Adds simple state-driven animation using `withAnimation` and `toggle`.      |
| `7_CoinsBindingView.swift`| Shows use of `@Binding` in a child view, allowing two-way state flow.       |
| `8_ObserverdWalletView.swift` | Demonstrates shared state using `ObservableObject` and `@Published`.     |

## üß™ Running the Project

You can paste each file into a new Swift Playground or SwiftUI project inside Xcode. These are great for classroom demos or building up your SwiftUI understanding step by step.
